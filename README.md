---

## What is this all about?

FOSS in education can be seen as a set of principles:

* Promote FOSS as an ideal replacement for Closed Source Software in educational environments.
* Help support the developers of the afformentioned software.
* Direct others to places where they may contribute code, effort, time, money, or any combination thereof.
* Go directly to schools to promote FOSS as a replacement for Closed Source Software.
